# <b>Critical Making Projects</b>

## <b>Reflection</b>
Welcome to Critical Making!

For this course, I did a series of experiments using various tools. I chose to focus my experiments on a few different themes – mainly the ideas of unflattening and exploring making through the use of music and emotionally-driven experiences.  Some of the projects include:

<b>Selfie:</b>
For this project, we had to take a selfie and turn it into something material. I was largely inspired by the ideas in Nick Sousanis’s Unflattening, and so tried to unflatten my project by bringing in 3D and textural elements with cross-stitch and crochet, as well as giving part of the piece motion.

<b>Comic:</b>
Creating this comic was my first foray into exploring making through the context of music, which I would later learn is called data sonification.

<b>Twine:</b>
I was inspired by Lee Skallerup Bessette’s essay “Moving In and Out of Time,” and particularly the use of music to create emotion and a sense of time and place. I decided to continue my exploration into the use of music to build an experience by building a text-based game with world building that relies heavily on the music being played in the background throughout.

<b>Bitsy:</b>
For my Bitsy project, I continued with the use of music but focused more on the emotional impact of the piece, including visual elements such as color choice. I have since learned that this is a turn toward data visceralization.

<b>P5.js:</b>
For my final project, I chose to combine the ideas of music and emotion by using the falling words template to create a visual representation of the song “Carol of the Bells.” By playing with the repetition of the song, the falling words act both as a representation of snow and of the musical experience.
